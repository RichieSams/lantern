# Problem

Memory allocation and resource (buffer and image) creation in Vulkan is difficult (comparing to older graphics API-s, like D3D11 or OpenGL) for several reasons:

- It requires a lot of boilerplate code, just like everything else in Vulkan, because it is a low-level and high-performance API.
- There is additional level of indirection: `VkDeviceMemory` is allocated separately from creating `VkBuffer`/`VkImage` and they must be bound together. The binding cannot be changed later - resource must be recreated.
- Driver must be queried for supported memory heaps and memory types. Different IHVs provide different types of it.
- It is recommended practice to allocate bigger chunks of memory and assign parts of them to particular resources.

# Features

This library can help game developers to manage memory allocations and resource creation by offering some higher-level functions. Features of the library are divided into several layers, low level to high level:

1. Functions that help to choose correct and optimal memory type based on intended usage of the memory.
   - Required or preferred traits of the memory are expressed using higher-level description comparing to Vulkan flags.
2. Functions that allocate memory blocks, reserve and return parts of them (`VkDeviceMemory` + offset + size) to the user.
   - Library keeps track of allocated memory blocks, used and unused ranges inside them, finds best matching unused ranges for new allocations, takes all the rules of alignment and buffer/image granularity into consideration.
3. Functions that can create an image/buffer, allocate memory for it and bind them together - all in one call.

Additional features:

- Thread-safety: Library is designed to be used by multithreaded code.
- Configuration: Fill optional members of CreateInfo structure to provide custom CPU memory allocator and other parameters.
- Customization: Predefine appropriate macros to provide your own implementation of all external facilities used by the library, from assert, mutex, and atomic, to vector and linked list. 
- Support memory mapping, reference-counted internally. Support for for persistently mapped memory: Just allocate with appropriate flag and you get access to mapped pointer.
- Custom memory pools: Create a pool with desired parameters (e.g. fixed or limited maximum size) and allocate memory out of it.
- Support for VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation extension: Enable it and it will be used automatically by the library.
- Defragmentation: Call one function and let the library move data around to free some memory blocks and make your allocations better compacted.
- Lost allocations: Allocate memory with appropriate flags and let the library remove allocations that are not used for many frames to make room for new ones.
- Statistics: Obtain detailed statistics about the amount of memory used, unused, number of allocated blocks, number of allocations etc. - globally, per memory heap, and per memory type.
- Debug annotations: Associate string with name or opaque pointer to your own data with every allocation.
- JSON dump: Obtain a string in JSON format with detailed map of internal state, including list of allocations and gaps between them.

# Prequisites

- Self-contained C++ library in single header file. No external dependencies other than standard C and C++ library and of course Vulkan.
- Public interface in C, in same convention as Vulkan API. Implementation in C++.
- Interface documented using Doxygen-style comments.
- Platform-independent, but developed and tested on Windows using Visual Studio.
- Error handling implemented by returning `VkResult` error codes - same way as in Vulkan.

# Example

Basic usage of this library is very simple. Advanced features are optional. After you created global `VmaAllocator` object, a complete code needed to create a buffer may look like this:

```cpp
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
bufferInfo.size = 65536;
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
allocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;

VkBuffer buffer;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
```

With this one function call:

1. `VkBuffer` is created.
2. `VkDeviceMemory` block is allocated if needed.
3. An unused region of the memory block is bound to this buffer.

`VmaAllocation` is an object that represents memory assigned to this buffer. It can be queried for parameters useful e.g. if you want to map the memory on host.
