TODO List
====================

- ~~**Re-add support for specular materials - Medium**~~ - Added in [20f4b81](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/20f4b81b26f4b158c43da0a1e277cc7e40caf66b)
- **Create a OpenGL renderer view - Easy/Medium**
	- Start with just being able to switch between path tracing and OpenGL
	- Need to decide whether to use "modern" OpenGL, or fixed pipeline
		- Leaning towards modern, since custom shaders might be useful in the future
		- In addition, I am more familiar with the modern model, since it is more similar to DX11
- **Be able to debug parts of the render - Hard**
	- I'm envisioning something like RenderDoc
	- So you press a button to "Record the next frame". 
	- Then it records all the rays that are shot, etc.
		- This will be diffucult to cleanly implement
			- We will need to come up with a way to serialize different types of 'events'
				- Perhaps some kind of polymorphism
				- With base member values, like pixel pos, and path number, to help sort/bin the events
		- Since it will somehow require instrumenting a lot of the code base, and passing around a 'logger' object, (per thread)
		- If possible, I would prefer if the instrumentation could be compiled out with pre-processor type logic
			- So in full release builds, the logging code doesn't exist
		- Initial ideas:
			- Pass the logger in as a dependency for functions
			- Surround logger code with a macro or #ifdef guards
			- If logging is disabled, the logger dependency might be removed in dead code elimination
				- It wouldn't be the end of the world if it didn't, since the logger param will just be a pointer
	- After the record, it switches to OpenGL view, where you can view the results
		- The interface for this is going to be one of the hardest parts
		- I would like it to be something like RenderDoc, where you can 'pick' a pixel, and see all the paths drawn
		- It would be very nice to be able to visualize the sampling. 
			- For example, to draw the disc and ray chosen for general area light shapes
- **Implement other BRDFs - Medium**
- ~~**Implement normal/UV interpolation - Easy**~~ - Added in [6735168](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/673516887c3ca1ae4f2e22ac48415cb68f62365f), [2c92ec3](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/2c92ec3fc15b59980dfbf510d4b3dc1cde922a6d), [25a16f2](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/25a16f2bf398ed80bfce7bf7b1affd47157ebc91)
- ~~**Implement JSON scene loading - Medium**~~ Added in [b021497](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/b021497cd2033e1bfc8e104555f76038a12e6a5f), [1f03f32](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/1f03f32332692ea46f8f5ddfd38b5a4418ba4b55), [c762815](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/c762815fefbec78ced5e3f1edefc214e6297adf9)
- **Implement using textures for material properties - Medium**
	- First, implement UV interpolation
	- Then using that to get real triangle UVs, implement the others
	- https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr and/or https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h could be really nice drop-ins for the actual reading of the texture data
- **Create a nice test render scene - Medium/Hard**
	- Start purusing some free 3D model sites
	- And free PBR texture sites
		- https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?90245-Free-PBR-Texture-Vol-01
		- http://opengameart.org/content/yughues-free-pbr-metal-plates
		- http://freepbr.com/
	- I have access to Quixel Suite, but I won't be able to re-distribute them
	- But, on that note, I probably won't share the scenes in git, since they will be quite large
		- Perhaps, for the scenes that *are* redistributable, I can upload them to my site
- **Implement transmissive materials - Medium**
	- ~~Implement ideal specular refraction and transmission~~ - Added in [4feb070](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/4feb07069a95c1175402552432e4e81f36489521)
	- ~~Implement isotropic scattering media~~ - Added in [eff77d8](https://github.com/RichieSams/lantern/commit/eff77d848a511656ba0196a60332b6685688c788)
	- Implement non-isotripic scattering media (Henyey-Greenstein, Raleigh, etc.)
- **Have a framebuffer / visualization that shows how many bounces each pixel is averaging**
	- Heatmap??
- **Update camera to full cartesian**
